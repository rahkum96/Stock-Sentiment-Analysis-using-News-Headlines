    "\n",
    "- The data set in consideration is a combination of the world news and stock price shifts.\n",
    "- Data ranges from 2008 to 2016 and the data from 2000 to 2008 was scrapped from Yahoo finance.\n",
    "- There are 25 columns of top news headlines for each day in the data frame.\n",
    "- Class 1- the stock price increased.\n",
    "- Class 0- the stock price stayed the same or decreased.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### About the approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Used TF-IDF and Bag of Words for extracting featues from the headlines.\n",
    "- Used Random Forest Classifier, Multinational Naive Bayes \n",
